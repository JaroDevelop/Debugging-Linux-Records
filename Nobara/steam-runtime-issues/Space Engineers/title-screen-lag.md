It seems that since the proton update that is able to run .wmv files it seems the background video of the title screen is causing lag.
Once in a mutliplayer or singlplayer world the lag dissapears.
It seems that wmv support is still spotty with proton.
I will try to look for a way to disable the wmv file.
