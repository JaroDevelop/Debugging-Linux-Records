For the latest version of proton GE and proton-expiermental. I crashed reletively quickly withing 8 minutes of gameplay I hit a hotkey on the world map
and I crash.
Also I crash faster in multiplayer maybe withing 3 to 5 minutes of gameplay. Just by playing. There is no trigger needed.
I remember having similar crashes for bannerlord when I previously tried out fedora a few years back. Way before Nobara was a thing.

If I recall correctly Space engineers played great with GE while Bannerlord was hot garbage.
I'm going to install SE to see if Space engineers works better... or at all.

I'll post more here if I find anything else out.
Look for the logs folder for bannerlord and SE.
