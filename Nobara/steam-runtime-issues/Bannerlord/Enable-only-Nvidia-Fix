This fixes my crashes and otherwisem poor performance in bannerlord.

THIS IS VERY SIMILAR to my Arch Enable only-Nvidia fix to run steam games at all.
This also just fixes bannerlord. I will have to test Space Engineers if this fix breaks it.

The steps are as follows.
In terminal do these commands

cd ..
cd ..
cd usr
cd share
cd vulkan
cd icd.d
sudo mv intel_icd.i686.json intel_icd.i686.json.disabled
sudo mv intel_icd.x86_64.json intel_icd.x86_64.json.disabled
sudo mv radeon_icd.i686.json radeon_icd.i686.json.disabled
sudo mv radeon_icd.x86_64.json radeon_icd.x86_64.json.disabled

This works very much the same. Just you only need to do icd.d
The other ones in implicit_layer.d are REALLY different than those on arch.

Hope this helps -Jedh
