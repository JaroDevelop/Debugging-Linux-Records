Basically after an update to proton-expiermental I got some serious audio-popping issues crackling the works.
I then was suggested to roll back to a stable version of proton 7.0-3 it practically fixed my problem after switching to stereo in my game settings
then restarting the game. The Said game was Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.
