As expected this game runs above and beyond with Proton GE.
Previously on arch without GE SE world crash on title screen consistently 
I expect this because of the wmv file playing is what making it crash.
the wmv file and the audio doesn't stutter as much.

With proton GE it surprisingly Doesn't crash and there are no pressing audio issues.
once loaded in the stutter-lag is gone and the game plays really well
